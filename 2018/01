On behalf of all of the Shotbow staff team, I wish you a very happy new year. While 2017 had its ups and downs, we are pleased to say that we have a lot in store for 2018! We are all very excited to present our awesome projects to you – some of which have been in the works for weeks, months, and even [I]years[/I]. Here's a small teaser, as well: we're working to bring two new games to Shotbow this year - one that you're expecting and one that you're not!

In celebration of 2018, use XP code [B]2018[/B] for a nice surprise! :) On that note, please enjoy our first New Moon of 2018.
