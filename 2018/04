Just yesterday, we rolled out a special new event for Easter: an Easter Egg Hunt! The Easter bunny needs your help finding all of his eggs, and if you find all of them, you could get a [I]lot[/I] of XP.

In addition, we have a ton of new Easter cosmetics for you to enjoy, including a limited-edition Easter Bunny Pet and Easter icons.
