Welcome to this month's edition of Dentril's New Moon. I'm your host, Mistri, and I'm so glad to have you!

You may or may not have noticed that we don't have a letter from the co-lead or a development corner this month â€” this is because Navarr is on temporary leave due to personal issues. We wish him the best and hope he's back soon!

The [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/summer-festival-2018.388873/']Shotbow Summer Festival[/URL] took place last weekend, featuring a new lobby, an XP code, and a returning map "Feastal"!

In addition, the development team has been working hard to mitigate the lag that some users may have been experiencing during games.
