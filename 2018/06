[SIZE=4][I]A follow-up by Navarr[/I][/SIZE]

There’s not a whole lot to say this month - we’re still chugging along on GhostCraft, and I’m doing my best to keep what small marketing engine we have running. One of the tests I ran this month with that was live streaming the Annihilation Tournament games to Facebook (as well as our many other platforms).

While we did not get a lot of live viewers on Facebook, we did get a lot of views and likes on the videos afterwards. While we may not continue live streaming to Facebook (due to cost), it’s very likely I’ll get back in the habit of cross-posting our videos there.

If you haven’t yet, please like us on Facebook at http://facebook.com/ShotbowOfficial and several or all of our various games’ pages. We’ll be expanding what games have pages depending on popularity and request.

In the same marketing vein, we also launched our newsletter this month. If you haven’t signed up you can do so at http://j.mp/shotbow-signup. This was very important to us as our previous system for getting out news and information just wasn’t working. If you haven’t yet, please do sign up. As of right now, we’re sticking true to sending an XP code with every newsletter send to the list.

As for transparency - I guess I don’t have much I can say here. I’ve certainly noticed some of our developers reaching out to the playerbase on the forums more often for ideas, comments, concerns and the likes. But as for how we’re doing - I’ll need you to tell me. Please leave a comment on the forums telling us how we’re doing in regards to our goal of more transparency. Please be constructive - if you think we should be more transparent in some way, tell us what that way is.

Thanks for reading, and as always - thank you for flying Shotbow. I leave you now in the capable hands of Mistri.

Hey folks! Hope everyone is doing well. For those of you with finals, good luck! I personally just finished mine (hence why the New Moon is a few hours late), so the next few weeks will be dedicated Shotbow time! Please enjoy this month's New Moon.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=5][B]Developer Corner[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[SIZE=4][I]By Navarr[/I][/SIZE]

The feedback to last month’s developer corner was pretty good. I’m happy to see that many enjoyed reading up on what exactly it is our developers are doing.

One of the hardest parts of writing this is deciding how much we can or should say about what our developers are doing. For example - when someone is working on anti-cheat type things, we can really only say that we’re improving admin tools, or the game, or something else - and likewise that’s pretty much all I can say when I get a “we’ve fixed a ton of small bugs in x.” I’m doing my best over here.

As always, your reminder that we’re not making promises as to how soon or long it will be until we release anything mentioned here. Developers move about different projects as needed/desired.

That said, we are currently pushing for Gold Rush to hit an Alpha as soon as we possibly can.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Murgatron[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
I’ll be honest, I’ve never really considered Murgatron a developer - but he keeps sending me monthly updates, so I guess I’ll talk about what he’s been doing. Let me just look over these notes.. Hmm, yeah.. Can’t really say that out explicitly.. Maybe I can reword it? Ah, yeah, here we go.

This month Murgatron was happy to report that he worked together with the Development Team to help fight back cheaters with the second best tools available to us - technology! Fighting off cheaters is a cat and mouse game that requires constant attention, and Murg and the Development Team were on top of it this past month.

He was also proud to report that he continued working with the team to move Gold Rush forward. He believes we’re very close to an alpha release, which should play well with our internal goal of launching that this summer.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Robertthegoat[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Robert has been spending a lot of his time working on Gold Rush. There’s lots of tweaks, bug fixes, and other things going on here. One exciting thing perhaps is that he’s very focused on ensuring Gold Rush has localization support (at my behest). This is great news, as I have been pushing since its inception for Gold Rush to be one of, if not THE first game on the network fully localized into Japanese. Our expanding localization team is standing by ready to translate - so I can’t wait for that alpha!
In addition to Gold Rush, Robertthegoat took some time to work on quality of life improvements to GhostCraft. The staff have been getting together and playing it a few times this month and after witnessing some bugs he decided he wanted to round them up and squash them like.. Bugs…

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]DocCodeSharp[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Doc has spent a great portion of this month focused on internal processes (yes, still - you wouldn’t believe how long some of that type of stuff takes), squashing MineZ bugs and refactoring it’s code for stability purposes, and performing other quality of life improvements related to keeping cheaters off our servers.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]skillerfox3[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Skiller has been working on Gold Rush alongside Robertthegoat to fix those bugs and polish that game. He specifically mentioned some quality of life improvements like adding death messages and improving the existing map objectives.

Have I mentioned yet how excited I am for Gold Rush?

Anyway, here's one final thing I'd like to say: no comment from a developer doesn't mean they didn't do anything, it just means that they may not have told us what they did. Anyway, thanks for reading, and see you next month!
- Navarr

With that, I bid you farewell. I'm your host, Mistri. See you next month!
