Hi there! My name is Mistri and I'm your host for this month's edition of Dentril's New Moon.

Unfortunately, this month we once again don't have a letter from the co-lead or a development corner due to Navarr being on temporary leave because of personal issues. However, many of the developers have been giving public info to put in the New Moon, so hopefully this makes up for it! Without further ado, I present this month's updates!
