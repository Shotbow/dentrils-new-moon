[SIZE=4][I]by Navarr[/I][/SIZE]

Does it feel like this month moved too quickly to anyone else? We’re closing out the second quarter and it’s time to review our goal.

I think we managed to do fairly well. There was a lot of positive feedback on the forums - albeit also some negative. Most of the negative feedback focused on some interesting specifics of opening up information on ban appeals and other such things. I’m sad to say that we can’t currently fulfill those desires, but it is a takeaway that I’ll keep in mind for the far future. On several fronts the staff have been encouraged to communicate with the community and I’ve definitely seen some of that occurring. I hope we can continue this forward pace of community feedback and increased openness as we move forward.

That said, we’re bringing a new theme into focus - and this quarter it’s Community Interaction. We want to spend more time communicating with, playing with, and otherwise having a blast with our community. There are a few ways we’re going to go about this:

[LIST]
[*]We’re working with the development team to make the Anni Sandbox available so we can start having regular Annihilation events again - even before the end of the tournament
[*]It is our goal to release Gold Rush this quarter into a restricted alpha. During this intensive testing phase, our staff team will be playing and looking for a lot of feedback.
[*]I hope to have at least one live Q&A in the Discord this quarter - and I look forward to fielding your questions - hopefully alongside my partner Murgatron - at least once ;)
[/LIST]

In addition to Gold Rush, the big pieces of our roadmap this quarter are 1.12.2 support - there’s only a couple other high priority tasks in front of it and I hope we can resolve those soon - and we’re hoping to release MineZ Origins Part II before the end of the year.

On that note - please let me know how you think we did in regards to our focus of increased transparency in the last quarter - and also let me know what kind of staff interaction events you want to see in the coming months!

That’s all for now - and as always, thank you for flying Shotbow.

[SIZE=4][I]By Navarr[/I][/SIZE]

Hi all, Navarr here! I did a less than stellar job of being on top of the developers this month for updates. As such, we don’t have a lot of juicy goodness for you to read. That said, here’s the reports I got:

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Robertthegoat[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Robert spent his time this month working on Gold Rush and participating in the development stream. He also worked on a couple secret items that we hope to reveal to you in gameplay within the next couple quarters.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]DocCodeSharp[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Doc spent a lot of this month working on infrastructure projects such as tackling issues with servers coming online and modernizing our deployment stack. In addition, he continued his work on refactoring the MineZ codebase for performance, stability, and general bugfixing purposes.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Skillerfox3[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Skiller continued his work on Gold Rush this month, including some initial work on balancing general gameplay. You’ve heard Murg refer to a large issue of “snowballing” where when one team is in the lead it becomes far too difficult to take it from them - this is one of those core balancing issues we’ll be focusing on both before and during the alpha testing phases. Skiller also worked on some admin tooling - improving our staff’s lives so we can improve your experience in the games.

And that’s all I have! I hope to tell you more next month, but until then - this is Navarr signing off!

With that, I bid you farewell. I'm your host, Mistri. Please let us know what you think about the New Moon in the comments. We love to hear your feedback!
