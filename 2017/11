[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]A Moment of Reflection[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/dentrils-new-moon-october-2017.378835/']Last month[/URL], we promised you that October would be a great month. Ghostcraft is back, Annihilation and many other games got large updates, and the Shotbow Spookfest was very enjoyable this year. How did we do? What can we improve on next time? Let us know in a comment so we can take it into account and improve for the next event (coming soon :wink: ) -- while we may not respond to every single post, just know that our team is always reading the forums and constantly taking things into account behind the scenes.
 
I'm your host, Mistri. Thanks for flying Shotbow!
