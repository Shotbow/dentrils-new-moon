The SMASH team has introduced a new system which allows Media Partners and Creators to host their own events on an exclusive map which they can customise to their own liking. This feature can be accessed using the small YouTube block which is located near the big fountain in the SMASH lobby. Stay tuned for broadcasts that signal when these fun events are starting!

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Civ-War Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
The current phase is getting to an end and there will be a new phase within the next month. The rought timeframe is around 2 weeks until someone wins, and then 1 week of downtime (where the server will still be up). After this, Civ-War will release its second beta (with a lot of new features), open to the public. Until then, all premiums can still join the server!
