With 1.9 out of the way, we spent some time this past month bringing in new staff again to help get the ball rolling. You might even recognize some of these people:

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Region Consolidation[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
For the second time in its history, Shotbow is consolidating regions. EU.shotbow.net now points to US.shotbow.net, and games will be figuring out how best to consolidate their stats and inventories across regions. You can read more about the decision in [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/eu-server-retirement.373348/']HighlifeTTU's post: EU Server Retirement[/URL]
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Media Program Changes[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
Starting with the spelling, there will be some fairly large changes coming to our partnership program. The biggest thing we're going to do is open up the floodgates to more creators. We'll have more to say on these changes later this month.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Return of SMASH[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

We're so pleased to be able to announce the return of SMASH to the network - now on 1.9! Superbob101, Kingey, and JesseTheDemon have been hard at work to bring you back one of our most loved games.
 
Perhaps most exciting of all is the return of the SMASH Ranked system!
 
There's a lot more news involved, and you can read all of that over in the [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/1-9-smash-is-here-changelog.372496/']SMASH Changelog for 1.9[/URL].
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Annihilation Class Update[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
[media=youtube]Lo1khEImFpA[/media]
 
Following the awesome re-launch of SMASH to 1.9, our development team followed it up with the Annihilation Class Update!
 
The action-packed update includes more tweaks than I can enunciate and brings a whole new class: Robin Hood. You can read all the beautiful details [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/class-update.373123/']in the Annihilation Class Update changelog[/URL].
 
Since such a large release was planned, we also took the opportunity to give Annihilation it's own logo. What do you think?
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Civ-War[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

Shotbow is very pleased to announce that we are in early talks to bring you Civ-War -- the latest refresh of the game originally known as CivilizationCraft. We'll have more to say about Civ-War in the coming months.
 
In the meantime, you can check up on their progress at [URL='http://www.civ-war.com/']Civ-War.com[/URL].
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=3][B]Death by Void[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

Not a lot to say here, but we did refresh the imagery we use for Death by Void. You can see it.. well, right here!
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]New Partners[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

In the last month we were [URL='https://twitter.com/ShotbowNetwork/status/867029592703471617']pleased to announce[/URL] our partnership with Lancey of the [URL='https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHeroLance']Lanceypooh[/URL] YouTube channel. Lance was recording a MineZ series where he and a friend try to see how far they can survive without dying while mapping out the world.

There's a lot expected to happen this month, with the brunt of the work of region consolidation happening early on. Some games are still deciding on how they're going to merge, but you can expect that the staff at the helm have the best interests of their players in their hearts.
 
In addition to the great consolidation, the Public Relations team is hoping to launch their revised Media Program before July.
 
And in the meantime the MineZ build and development teams will be hard at work on Origins Part II and possibly the return of the Revelations podcast.
 
That's all we've got - I'm Navarr, your host, and thank you for flying Shotbow.
