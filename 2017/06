With 1.9 out of the way, we spent some time this past month bringing in new staff again to help get the ball rolling.  You might even recognize some of these people:

We're so pleased to be able to announce the return of SMASH to the network - now on 1.9!  Superbob101, Kingey, and JesseTheDemon have been hard at work to bring you back one of our most loved games.

Perhaps most exciting of all is the return of the SMASH Ranked system!

There's a lot more news involved, and you can read all of that over in the [url=https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/1-9-smash-is-here-changelog.372496/]SMASH Changelog for 1.9[/url].

Following the awesome re-launch of SMASH to 1.9, our development team followed it up with the Annihilation Class Update!

The action-packed update includes more tweaks than I can enunciate and brings a whole new class: Robin Hood.  You can read all the beautiful details [url=https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/class-update.373123/]in the Annihilation Class Update changelog[/url].

Since such a large release was planned, we also took the opportunity to give Annihilation it's own logo.  What do you think?

Shotbow is very pleased to announce that we are in early talks to bring you Civ-War -- the latest refresh of the game originally known as CivilizationCraft.  We'll have more to say about Civ-War in the coming months.

In the meantime, you can check up on their progress at [url=http://www.civ-war.com/]Civ-War.com[/url].

Not a lot to say here, but we did refresh the imagery we use for Death by Void.  You can see it.. well, right here!
