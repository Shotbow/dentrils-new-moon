We're so pleased to be able to announce the return of SMASH to the network - now on 1.9!  Superbob101, Kingey, and JesseTheDemon have been hard at work to bring you back one of our most loved games.

Perhaps most exciting of all is the return of the SMASH Ranked system!

There's a lot more news involved, and you can read all of that over in the [url=https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/1-9-smash-is-here-changelog.372496/]SMASH Changelog for 1.9[/url].

Shotbow is very pleased to announce that we are in early talks to bring you Civ-War -- the latest refresh of the game originally known as CivilizationCraft.  We'll have more to say about Civ-War in the coming months.

In the meantime, you can check up on their progress at [url=http://www.civilizationcraft.net/]CivilizationCraft.net[/url].
