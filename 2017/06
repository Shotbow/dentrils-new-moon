With 1.9 out of the way, we spent some time this past month bringing in new staff again to help get the ball rolling.  You might even recognize some of these people:

[SIZE=6][b]Return of SMASH[/b][/SIZE]

We're so pleased to be able to announce the return of SMASH to the network - now on 1.9!  Superbob101, Kingey, and JesseTheDemon have been hard at work to bring you back one of our most loved games.

Perhaps most exciting of all is the return of the SMASH Ranked system!

There's a lot more news involved, and you can read all of that over in the [url=https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/1-9-smash-is-here-changelog.372496/]SMASH Changelog for 1.9[/url].
