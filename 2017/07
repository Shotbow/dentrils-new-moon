[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Control Status Update[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
You might remember a series of games collectively referred to as "Wasted," yes? It was another fun game pieced together by Shotbow that brought such exhilarating features to Minecraft like an honest to goodness true weapon system (at an age where everyone was using pretty bad snowballs), various guns, ammunition, bombs, and destructive & regenerating terrain.
 
One of our favorite iterations of this was Wasted: Control - a control-point style game with a flag lowering and raising system that was all the rage.
 
While Wasted, Control, and GunGame went to the Garage last year for some large bouts of refactoring, the engineers in that garage are happy to report that Control is under construction and will be the first game of the series to have fresh life breathed into it. You can check out the thread [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/wasted-in-the-coming-year-part-iii.373294/']Wasted in the Coming Year Part III[/URL] by Robertthegoat to read up more on the history and future of this splendiferous game.

During this month, Shotbow was also proud to be one of the first major servers to fully roll out support for Minecraft 1.12. Our ability to roll the update out so quickly was entirely thanks to aet2505 and the huge amount of work he did both during the 1.9 update and the fresh work to ensure the protocol was supported across the network.
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Region Consolidation[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
US/EU Region Consolidation is still underway. MTA and MineZ are likely the hardest games to consolidate. I do have an update on one game though - SMASH consolidated ELO earlier this month by selecting the higher of US or EU (which is probably the best way to do that). However, the SUMMER 2017 SMASH Season starts now - so there's no use worrying about it anymore!

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Slaughter Updates![/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
More game updates? Don't mind if I do...
 
Slaughter is pleased to present two new maps: Frost, and Extinct - both made by the fantastic builder Friendly123.
 
[B]BUT WAIT! ORDER NOW AND YOU'LL ALSO RECEIVE:[/B] [I]All Redstone and Command Blocks BUGFIX[/I].
 
I'm no hardcore Slaughter player - and that's because the whole lot of them just rushed back in to enjoy their favorite game. You should give it a go, too!
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Annihilation Updates![/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
This month also saw some tweaks to Annihilation, with Robin Hood's starting arrow count doubling and a new Arrow Recall ability! (Accurate shots on a target have a 60% chance of returning the arrow! Wowza!)
 
Mercenary also got some needed tweaks (though you might consider them nerfs - they [I]were[/I] unintentional functionality) - Mark of Death no longer targets those not in Line of Sight, nor those pesky vanished Spies! Drat!
 
The Annihilation Team would also like me to remind you that they are working on a Part 2 to the Classes Update, and that they have some big changes coming up.
 
You can read more details on these changes and discuss the coming update in the [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/class-update-minor-tweaks.374278/']Class Update: Minor Tweaks[/URL] changelog thread.
 
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Revised Media Program[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
 
June also saw us make a massive change to our Media Program, once again opening the floodgates for submissions - which has as of yet, not gone poorly! We've added a ton of new partners this month and are trekking through our grandfathered partners and removing those no longer with us.
 
You can read about the changes and see if you can apply over in the [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/the-new-shotbow-media-program.373858/']New Shotbow Media Program announcement thread[/URL].
