It has really been a crazy month hasn’t it. The one thing you almost assuredly believed would not happen [I]did[/I].
Shotbow updated to 1.9.
 
Over a year of making sure the worst bugs were fixed, attempting to find a proper launch window, and all manner of other craziness - Shotbow did the one thing they were threatening to do.
 
And there was much.. Conflicted feelings.
 
Either way, we’ve released the 1.9 update to the network - 1.7 and 1.8 clients can no longer connect, and 1.9/1.10/1.11 clients should be able to connect without issue. Hopefully future updates will be less of a massive jump. This means you should expect us to drop 1.9 support in the future.
 
It’s always been this way for Shotbow. I mean, we certainly didn’t release MineZ (June 25, 2012) on 1.7. We released it on [I]1.2[/I] and we’ve been updating and dropping versions since. Now, we’ve finally dropped support for 1.7 (Oct 2013 - June 2014).
 
And with that, we move on to the rest of this month’s news.

[SIZE=5][B]Mine Theft Auto: The High-end Update[/B][/SIZE]
[media=youtube]q8Ik2EdF4_Y[/media]
Teased back in October, Mine Theft Auto has finally (with the release of 1.9 across Shotbow) had the opportunity to release their big update. With a new, powerful helicopter police AI, riot shields, gang houses, dungeons, and more (DUAL WIELDING!) it’s probably the best time to check out Mine Theft Auto.

[SIZE=5][B][B]MineZ: Origins - Part 1[/B][/B][/SIZE]
[media=youtube]Vgw09D5umhI[/media]
Another large update to the MineZ World - bringing with it dungeons, lore, new locations, and new mobs - and this is only [I]part 1[/I]. A lot of work has gone into nailing down what the dungeon experience is supposed to be and this new update offers a marked improvement over what The Secret Update changed in the dungeon experience. Get out there and explore!

[SIZE=5][B][B]Slaughter[/B][/B][/SIZE]
Many were unhappy that Slaughter was not immediately available upon release. We worked out a few large kinks and are pleased to say that Slaughter is now available to play!

[SIZE=5][B][B]Annihilation: The Classes Update[/B][/B][/SIZE]

Not yet released - the Shotbow staff has been live streaming and holding closed betas of the first update to Annihilation post 1.9. This update has been in planning for as long as we’ve been waiting to update to 1.9 and the team is very excited to release it. After all, games tend to stagnate over time and we’re hoping to inject some more fun right back into Annihilation. This update includes some new classes and some modifications to many of the existing classes.

[SIZE=6][B]Non-Update Information[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE=5][B]SMASH[/B][/SIZE]
Previous potential 1.9 releases were held up by SMASH not being completely ready - so when this latest window of opportunity presented itself, we went ahead and released without SMASH. We are not yet prepared to place SMASH in the garage - as the game is very important to us - but we are working on ironing out the bugs with SMASH so it can come back very soon. So it’s [I]in the garage[/I] but not quite [I]long term storage[/I], if you know what I mean.
 
[SIZE=5][B][B]Qubion[/B][/B][/SIZE]
Qubion is not quite in the same situation as SMASH. Due to the unique nature of Qubion, and the large world size, it’s a little harder to get the update going while Qubion continued in its previous version. Our developers are working on bringing Qubion up to speed while keeping the existing world and ranks.
 
[SIZE=5][B][B]MineZ 2[/B][/B][/SIZE]
Sadly due to the new developer’s disappearance, and the massive amount of work MineZ 2 is in general, coupled with our lean, volunteer team, we had to make the decision to place MineZ 2 in the long-term storage section of The Garage. For all intents and purposes, MineZ 2 is now over. It is possible it may make a return in the future, but unlikely with the same game data and mechanics.
 
[SIZE=5][B][B]The Weekly Arrow[/B][/B][/SIZE]
BAM. GONE. Sorry, but I don’t ever want to go back to writing a weekly changelog that people mostly visit for the XP Codes. So this is our new format - a monthly little newsletter that gives you some brief updates and points you to where you can find out more. Internally we’re going to encourage posting large update information straight to the homepage here, and individual forums will likely contain smaller changelogs - making the necessity of a weekly changelog unnecessary.
 
[SIZE=6][B]The Coming Moon[/B][/SIZE]
You should expect this next month to continue its focus on bug fixing, with additional time being put into the next Origins update by the build team, and the coming Annihilation updates by the development team. We do not currently have any expectation of launching these updates within the coming month, but it [I]is [/I]where our team will be putting their time.
