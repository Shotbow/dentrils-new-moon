Hey Shotbow! Happy September. My name is Mistri and I'm your host for this month's edition of Dentril's New Moon.

Over the past few weeks, we have noticed some major lag spikes on Shotbow, and while we don't have a fix quite yet, we're working hard to resolve these lag spikes. We're just as frustrated as you are with this, and we hope you be patient along with us as we work on fixing this for everyone. Thanks!
