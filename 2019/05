Hello Shotbow! Throughout April, we had a lot of activity that I'm super excited to share with you! Please enjoy this month's edition of Dentril's New Moon.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=5][B]Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Network Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
First off, we're happy to tell you that we've added a special channel on our Discord called [B]#sneak-peeks[/B]. For the past few weeks, we've revealed several sneak peeks into coming MineZ changes. Be sure to join our Discord if you haven't already! https://discord.gg/shotbow

On the topic of Discord, today we shut down our official TeamSpeak server. Please use Discord for all official Shotbow communications. If you'd like to request more rooms or channels to be added in our Discord, please let us know and we'd be happy to hear your feedback. Once again, if you aren't in our Discord, the link can be found here: https://discord.gg/shotbow

Next up, we're happy to let you know that the new Shotbow Wiki is now live! Read all about it [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/new-shotbow-wiki.393715/']here[/URL]. We also recently added an experimental mobile view to the wiki.

We also hosted a Q&A session with our leadership last month. If you missed out, you can watch it here:

In addition, we've pushed a change to our servers that prevents Legacy Minecraft accounts from connecting to the network, which helps us with cheater prevention. If you're interested in learning more, please read [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/preventing-the-connection-of-legacy-minecraft-accounts.393646/']this post[/URL].

Finally, please give a warm welcome [URL='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RtihQySB6KPbF5XWiyhHA']_Pom_[/URL] as our newest Media Partner!

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]MineZ Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Last month, MineZ added support for name changes for Media Producers in order for them to avoid targeting.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]GG Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
The MineZ Item Update PvP code has been rolled out to GG for testing. Now, GG PvP perfectly matches PvP in MineZ, and we hope that you find it to be closer to 1.7 PvP. Feedback is appreciated!
