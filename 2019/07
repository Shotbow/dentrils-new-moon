Hello!

We are happy to open applications once more for the Shotbow Build Team. If you've ever wanted to help shape the games you enjoy playing, or leave your mark on the server, this is your chance to.

In order to apply, please read these guidelines:
[LIST]
[*]All builders are vetted before being allowed to proceed, so we require you to tell the whole truth about your history on Shotbow.
[*]All builders are required to submit a portfolio of past builds. This is simply an album of your past builds. We ask that you please provide this portfolio in an Imgur album. These should be in the default texture pack with no shaders. We withhold the right to deny your application because you didnâ€™t follow this rule.
[*]All builders are required to have a microphone that they can use on Discord to communicate with the rest of the team.
[/LIST]
Being a builder is a unique opportunity to work with others on these modes, express yourself through building, and interact with players in a new manner. It has been a privilege for me to work with so many individuals over my 7 years helping Shotbow, and I hope to work with many more.

Any applicants that are chosen will receive a message via our forums with more information. We ask that you give at least a week between when you submit your application and when you should expect to receive a message about your application.
Hoping to hear from you and good luck!

- Halo

Lots of changes happened with MineZ this month. First and foremost, we released a suite of new updates to our PTR for player tests.
