Happy holidays, Shotbow! I'm Mistri, your host for the December edition of Dentril's New Moon.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=5][B]Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]Network Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
As you may remember, last month we transferred hosts to [URL='https://path.net/']Path[/URL]. During that time, however, not all servers were transferred completely, including the server used for development. For this reason, the developers and builders have been unable to make progress for a significant amount of this month, which is why there were not many gamemode updates this month. This issue is near resolved and you should be seeing updates once again starting in a few days.

On another note, we opened applications for the Film Crew, which are evaluated on a rolling basis. If you are experienced in editing or recording videos, and you're interested in producing content for the [URL='https://www.youtube.com/user/ShotBowNetwork']official Shotbow Youtube channel[/URL], [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/film-crew-applications-now-open.397843/']apply now[/URL]! Applications close December 15.

[COLOR=#e64a19][SIZE=4][B]MineZ Updates[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
In the last month, we've seen a lot of new faces on MineZ thanks to streamers. However, we unfortunately had to create new rules to deter people with malicious intent from ruining the streamer's experience, thereby deterring new players from Shotbow. This process, called "stream sniping", is now bannable. You can view these new rules [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/new-rule-stream-sniping.397930/']here[/URL].
