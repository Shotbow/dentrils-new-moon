December was a great month for Annihilation. For starters, we announced that we've (finally) released the brand-new [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/priority-queue.391198/']Priority Queue[/URL], which makes gameplay a lot fairer. We hope you are as excited as we are!

We also announced an update to our [URL='https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/map-rotation-schedule.390967/']Map Rotation Schedule[/URL], which is a complex system that allows less-represented maps to be played more often.

That's it for this month's updates, but I'd like to close with one final note: at the beginning of each year, the Shotbow team generally gives an update announcement with a reflection of the previous year and our goals for the next year. This will be coming in late January, so stay tuned for more! With that, I bid you farewell. I'm your host, Mistri. Thanks for flying Shotbow!
